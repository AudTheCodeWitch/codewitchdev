Hello, friends! Long time, no see! It’s been a minute since we last spoke, so let me catch you up. If you want the tl;dr
version, [visit my Polywork profile](https://www.polywork.com/audthecodewitch).

I wrapped up my time at [Raise.dev](https://raise.dev/) at the end of June. I loved the work I was doing there, but John
Britton, my best boss to date, encouraged me to find a new position that would challenge me in ways a small startup just doesn’t have the capacity for.

I didn’t _quite_ feel like I was ready, but I trusted my mentor. Now that I’m a month into my new gig as a software 
engineer at [dutchie](https://dutchie.com/), I am so glad I did. John has yet to steer me wrong!

## The Problem

Almost immediately after beginning my job search, I remembered just how much it sucks. From cold-contacting strangers on
LinkedIn to wracking my brain trying to remember the most important projects I accomplished at Raise.dev, it was all 
super stressful, and none of it felt natural.

Thinking over my time at Raise.dev, I can vaguely remember a few standout projects. I built 
[Raise.dev/LIVE](https://raise.dev/live#) as my first solo PR, created (probably over-complicated) progress boards for
our user dashboard, helped eliminate bot abuse of our registration form, and I worked to streamline and speed up our 
test suite.

What I don’t remember, however, are the highs and lows of each project, the specific challenges I overcame to merge 
those pull requests, or the countless other cool projects I worked on. I really only remember enough to flesh out my 
resume.

We all know a plain resume, or even [a polished LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/audreacook/), can only 
offer the tiniest glimpse of what an individual is actually like. While that snapshot may be good enough for a 
recruiter’s cursory glance, wouldn’t it be nice to offer your next interviewer a more detailed and engaging view of who 
you really are?

## The Solution

Enter [Polywork](https://www.polywork.com/invite/codewitchcoven), a new social networking platform designed to highlight
the best pieces of its users. Each user has their own profile, which essentially boils down to a kick-ass timeline of 
their accomplishments (and sometimes failures), both personal and professional. While you _can_ build out your profile 
just like you would on LinkedIn or a [traditional paper resume](https://codewitch.dev/about/resume), I encourage you to 
get a little creative and have some fun with it.

Instead of adding to the millions of other blog posts out there on how to network and land your next job, today I 
thought I would talk about how I plan to use Polywork to toot my own horn a bit, celebrate my wins, and make my next 
job search (hopefully a long time from now) suck a little less.


## Just Imagine...

Pretend you and I just met and were getting to know one another in real life. What would you share? Would our entire 
conversation revolve around work, or would we talk about our hobbies, families, and all the other areas of our lives 
that make us unique? Sure, work might come up, but would that be our sole focus? I kinda hope not.

Yes, I’m a software engineer. Yes, I do full-stack work and prefer mucking around in a Ruby on Rails backend. So what? 
Does that tell you who I really am? I don’t think so. My work resume tells you (all on one page, mind you) that I’m 
new-ish to the tech industry, I know how to use job-appropriate keywords, and I can organize some bullet points in a 
clean (if rather boring) way. Oh, joy of joys.

I like to think of my Polywork profile as “My Life’s Resume.” On it, I post the things I would love to share with a new 
friend or acquaintance. Scrolling through my last few months of Highlights (what Polywork calls posts), I have a few 
work-related wins, sure, but I also have 
[a picture of me at the beach](https://www.polywork.com/audthecodewitch/highlights/470c4a50-719a-4ff6-9cdd-47ef0ff26b30) 
with my beautiful sister and her two children. You’ll also see a few of the 
[crafts I’ve finished](https://www.polywork.com/audthecodewitch/highlights/ea313336-49eb-4865-876d-4ef0ff5ffc78), 
interesting books I’ve read, and whatever else I show off! You’ll get a better sense of who I actually am, not just what 
I do.

   <center><img src='/images/badges.png' alt='An assortment of Polywork badges'></center>

Remember those resume-friendly keywords? On Polywork, those translate to your badges. Of course I have 
“[Software Engineer](https://www.polywork.com/badges/software-engineer)” and 
“[Full Stack Developer](https://www.polywork.com/badges/full-stack-developer),” but I _also_ have the _much more 
important_ badges like “[Crocheter](https://www.polywork.com/badges/crocheter),” 
“[Dog Mum](https://www.polywork.com/badges/dog-mum),” “[Stardew Farmer](https://www.polywork.com/badges/stardew-farmer),” 
and “[Neopets Alumnus](https://www.polywork.com/badges/neopets-alumnus).” A user can pick as many badges as they’d like, 
making it easier to find like-minded people. Don’t see the perfect badge for you? Create your own badge, and share it 
with the Multiverse! You’ll find your people; trust me.


## Yeah, but… what about the job stuff?

Apologies for that tangent; I just really like the ability to share all the awesome parts of myself on Polywork! But I 
promised to tell you how I intend to use Polywork to make my next job search more bearable, so here are my five top tips:



#### 1. Your timeline is a living document.

   Don’t wait until your next job search to update your profile. When something interesting happens in your life 
   (professional or otherwise), add it to your timeline while it is fresh in your mind! You can always edit the 
   Highlight later if you feel you over shared or left something out. 
   
   Likewise, go backfill your timeline! Right now, I have my complete work history (all the way back to my first job) 
   and every one of my published blog posts on there. As I remember other significant (to me) events, I add them as 
   well. Most people won’t care that I spent 
   [July 20, 2019](https://www.polywork.com/audthecodewitch/highlights/8c750903-5bb2-4696-8dac-1a46ad46a676) flying to 
   Texas and back to pick up the newest member of my family, but I love scrolling through my timeline, seeing that 
   picture of baby Juniper Rose, and remembering that super stressful but wonderful day.

#### 2. Celebrate your wins.

   As a second-grade teacher, I learned to celebrate all the wins, big and small. Marissa just finished a new chapter 
   book? Three cheers for her! Tobias made his spelling test goal? Time for a mini dance party! Celebrating kids for 
   their efforts throughout the day built a supportive and loving classroom community. I like to think of Polywork as 
   the perfect place for us grownups to do the same.    
   
   So when you survive your first week at a new job, Highlight it! When you complete that craft you’ve been working on 
   for weeks, take a picture and share it with the world. And here’s my _favorite_ part about these posts: there’s no 
   “like” feature. You share what you want to share with the universe without worrying about winning some fabricated 
   popularity contest. Highlight your win, toot your own horn, and then go feel that tiny burst of joy when you see 
   countless others doing the same.

#### 3. Celebrate your ~~losses~~ learning opportunities.

   Just as I learned to celebrate every little success, teaching also taught me the value of failing in public. When I 
   misspelled a word on the board (a tragedy for my English-major heart), my students could see an adult make a mistake, 
   own up to it, and fix it. When the next spelling test rolled around, I would see students marking their mistakes, 
   rewriting it correctly, and moving on to the next thing. No tears, no pressure to cheat, just casual recognition that 
   they had something to work on. 
   
   When I merged my first pull request at dutchie, I also kinda-sorta 
   [introduced a bug that broke production](https://www.polywork.com/audthecodewitch/highlights/6675b9a0-261e-4308-aae9-a75257944710) 
   for a short time. 
   
   <center><img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/RKMm7X3HGKZMuoZlMF/giphy-downsized-large.gif' alt='Data from Star Trek 
saying, "I have not been entirely successful."'></center>

   Yes, it was mortifying in the moment, but I also recognized that it happens to every developer at 
   some point in their career. Instead of dwelling on the fact that I made a mistake, I owned up to it, learned something 
   new about our QA processes (mainly that I shouldn’t bypass them, even for teeny tiny PRs that make a seemingly 
   insignificant change), and worked with members of my team to get it fixed.

   How many interviews have you had where they said, “Tell me about a time you messed up at work. What did you do?” This 
   question used to stress me out beyond belief. I typically like to blot all evidence of a mistake from my memory! Why 
   make me dredge up something so painful and counter to the point I’m trying to make — that I’m the perfect candidate 
   for the job? 
   
   The truth is, I’m not the perfect candidate; nobody is. Normalizing the acceptance of failures and reframing them as 
   learning opportunities relieves that pressure to be perfect, encourages honesty between you and the interviewer, and 
   also shows you are resilient and capable, despite your imperfections. What’s not to celebrate about that?!

#### 4. Explore the Multiverse!

   Let’s step away from our personal timelines for a minute and see where the networking part of “social network” comes 
   into play. Polywork has a space called the [Multiverse](https://www.polywork.com/multiverse), which is akin to the 
   traditional feed on other, less amazing social networks. In the Multiverse, you can find like-minded individuals who 
   share the same badges and interests as you. Remember when I mentioned the ability to celebrate others’ achievements? 
   This is where you read all about them. 
   
   Of course, you can’t “like” a user’s Highlights, but there is nothing stopping you from giving them a follow and 
   sending a private message of encouragement or congratulations. I’ve also heard through the grapevine that a new 
   comment feature will be rolling out soon, which is how I plan to really engage with the Multiverse. Again, Polywork 
   isn’t a popularity contest, so the individual users get to choose if they would like to receive our contributions 
   from the peanut gallery. 
   
   Even without the comment feature, I always visit the Multiverse when I’m looking for a quick pick-me-up. Nothing 
   makes me happier than seeing other people living their best lives. 

   My main use for the Multiverse is to make more friends (I’m looking at you, 
   [Code Witches](https://www.polywork.com/badges/code-witch)!), but it’s also the perfect place to do some good, 
   old-fashioned networking, as it will introduce you to all sorts of rad people based on their badges. Hell, there are 
   even badges for ["Hiring"](https://www.polywork.com/badges/hiring), 
   ["Job Hunting"](https://www.polywork.com/badges/job-hunting), and 
   ["Networker"](https://www.polywork.com/badges/networker), making it super easy to connect with people who might help 
   you with your next career move.

#### 5. Visit the Space Station.

   If you’re looking for a mentor, beta testers for your new product, or simply someone to collaborate with, you’ve got 
   to check out the [Space Station](https://www.polywork.com/spacestation). When building your timeline, Polywork asks 
   what type of opportunities you would take part in. The Space Station groups people based on these selections, making 
   it dead simple to find people just waiting for you to reach out to them. No more cold-calling randos on LinkedIn; 
   now you can reach out to people who’ve already shown their interest in what you have to say! I’ll admit I haven’t 
   actively used this feature as much as I could, but I have met several new people who found me through the Space 
   Station, so I recommend you keep your list of opportunities you’d be interested in up to date.

## Ok, you got me… now what?

Come join the party at Polywork! There is usually a waiting list to sign up, but VIP codes that skip you to the front of 
the line are fairly easy to come by. 
<center><img src='/images/group.png' alt='A group of Polywork characters'></center>
In fact, if you’ve made it this far, you can 
[use my VIP link](https://www.polywork.com/invite/codewitchcoven) to get started building your own personal space! Once 
you do that, be sure to hit me up so I can follow along on your own magical journey. I look forward to seeing you there!
