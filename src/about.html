    Hi friends! My name is Audrea Cook, also known as the Code Witch. I
    graduated from Flatiron School's software engineering bootcamp in January of
    2020, and I am currently seeking a full-time developer position.

      I live in Colorful Colorado with my gorgeous husband and our two dogs.
      Ally, our shiba inu, is 99% fur. Juniper Rose, our whippet puppy, is 99%
      legs. They're an odd pair.

      When I'm not coding or crocheting, I've probably got my nose stuck in a
      book. With a degree in English literature, I just can't help it! My goal
      for the last few years has been to read at least one book a week. If you
      are a fellow bookworm, join me on
